Codes for computer vision
Summary:
Different computer vision libraries have been explored and their applicability is identified. Rea time object detection exercise is done with the code highlighted in yellow. Object segmentation is also investigated with the help of the detailed course by NVIDIA. Different neural networks were used to and the accuracy was observed over several Epochs. Code is also added towards the end of the document.

Understand the Computer Vision (Friday)
- Image Processing Techniques (perform common operations of each in code). 
- Opencv - Image detection using real-time video
- Numpy - numerical calculations
- Scipy    -  optimized numpy for data science.
- Pillow  - image processing 
- Matplotlib - visualise data
- dlib  - good for face recognition
- Pandas (Tabular Data) - used for tabular data.
- Object Detection - Run an example of any object detector and understand every line of code
