Codes for computer vision
Summary:
Different computer vision libraries have been explored and their applicability is identified. Rea time object detection exercise is done with the code highlighted in yellow. Object segmentation is also investigated with the help of the detailed course by NVIDIA. Different neural networks were used to and the accuracy was observed over several Epochs. Code is also added towards the end of the document.

Understand the Computer Vision (Friday)
- Image Processing Techniques (perform common operations of each in code). 
- Opencv - Image detection using real-time video
- Numpy - numerical calculations
- Scipy    -  optimized numpy for data science.
- Pillow  - image processing 
- Matplotlib - visualise data
- dlib  - good for face recognition
- Pandas (Tabular Data) - used for tabular data.
- Object Detection - Run an example of any object detector and understand every line of code

Explore the Computer Vision Libraries
- Tensorflow – This is an open source library by google that is primarily used for deep learning applications with several machine learning capabilities. Disadvantages include inconsistency, achitechtural limitation, dependency and slow speed. However, it is keras friendly, has high compatibility with graphical and architectural support.
- PyTorch – The is an updated version of the above mentioned library for deep learning that is mostly used for research and narrows the gap between prototyping and development. The is usually written in cpp from the backend to optimize processes. This library has a rich set of powerful APIs to extend the pytorch libraries. This library is used in computer vision and natural language processing applications. 
- Keras – This is another deep learning library which has a good deployment record on smartphones. Companies like Netflix, yelp and Uber use it for their customers for different applications. This is user friendly with multiple GPU support. disadvantages included problems in low-level API, slower backend and needs some improvements in some features. 
- OpenCV – This is the popular ML library for computer vision and image processing. This was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. The library it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today's systems. 
 
● What is research? 

Research is defined as careful consideration of study regarding a particular concern or problem using scientific methods.

● How People Do Research in the Software Development Industry ? 

There are mainly five ideal steps that people in the software development industry follow. These are controlled experiments (including Quasi-Experiments); case studies (both exploratory and confirmatory); survey research; ethnographies;  and action research.

● What are the prime factors to keep in mind while doing research?

1. Start broad, then dive into the specifics.
2. Learn how to recognize a quality source.
3. Verify information from several sources.
4. Be open to surprising answers.
5. Stay organized.
6. Take advantage of library resources.
7.
